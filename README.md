# Self-Driving-Car-with-Visualized-Neural-Network
Multiple neural networks are being trained with genetic algorithm (evolution and selection). You can see how they make decision in this very cool visualization. Everything in this project: the game, neural nets, and genetic algorithm were all made from scratch in Processing.
